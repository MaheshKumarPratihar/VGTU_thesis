TOPIC: Textual Data Clusterization Based on Self-organizing Maps and Word Embeddings
Description: 

During the work, it will be necessary to propose a solution that allows 
for the best possible grouping of data by context using word embedding 
methods and self-organizing maps. The dataset is chosen at the studentâ€™s 
discretion, and should already be labeled. Later, the results are validated 
based on how well they were grouped by the proposed solution.
